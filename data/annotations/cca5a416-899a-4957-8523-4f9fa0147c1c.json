It became the starting point for a dialogue on the ways one can manage the difficulties of the pandemic; whether as an artist or a spectator. That same day was the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the World Poetry Day. These three elements were enough to empower the members of the project the AfroGreeks to transform the empty city of Athens into a stage that would host a day-long action honouring the important messages of the day, taking into consideration the protective measures for Covid-19.\nThe protagonists of the AfroGreeks project performed in multiple locations, each with its own significance. The actions were all recorded and broadcasted live for Athenians to watch from the comfort of their homes and practice social distancing during the covid pandemic.  This event is an example of how art always finds a way and can be used in innovative ways to restore closeness."}]}],"tags":[{"tag":"Comment","category":"Annotation"}],"uuid":"0425fc5f-b984-4e15-bb4c-13c3504ecc33"},{"start_time":13,"end_time":21,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Pedion tou Areos is the largest public park in Athens.
