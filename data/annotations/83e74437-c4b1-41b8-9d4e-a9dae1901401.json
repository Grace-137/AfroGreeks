They were literally left without any form of legal identification that could justify their presence in the country. All they possessed was a birth certificate, which did not count as a valid identification document. While the first generation of migrants was eventually required to obtain residence permits to prove their entry and employment status in Greece, there was no corresponding legal provision for their children. This “second generation” was left in a state of bureaucratic limbo. For Black boys in particular, this gap had severe consequences: they were frequently racially profiled and stopped by police as early as age 15 or 17.

This would eventually turn into a form of dance resistance against their oppressors. \nSoon after, the miners evolved their percussive sounds and movements into a unique dance form and used it to entertain each other during their free time.
