On the projection in the background, you can see the live event organized in Geneva during the projects exhibition when Mikel and Kofi created a gathering which opened an alternative platform, shaped through art, hip hope battles and community. Through this event, they created space for connection, visibility, and collaboration with local Black artists in Geneva, offering a powerful reminder that community can be built even in places where it feels invisible. All this in a city where we questioned as Afro-Greeks whether a Black community exists.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Grace Nwoke","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Translation","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Mikel","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Kofi","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Dance","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://Grace-137.github.io/AfroGreeks/remember_this_song_the_afro_greeks_public_action_25_4_25/canvas/3#t=2240,2381"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://Grace-137.github.io/AfroGreeks/remember_this_song_the_afro_greeks_public_action_25_4_25/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":" Texts Read in English by Grace and translated by Xenia to Greek \nMartin Luther King said: \nWe not only have the right to be free, we have a duty to be free.\nJames Baldwin said: \nIn fact, we were simply trapped in the same situation.\nJames Baldwin said: \nYou get a great shock when you discover that the country where you were born and to which you owe your life and your identity has not provided in its whole system of reality an inch of space for you.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Comment","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://Grace-137.github.io/AfroGreeks/remember_this_song_the_afro_greeks_public_action_25_4_25/canvas/3#t=2382,2687"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://Grace-137.github.io/AfroGreeks/remember_this_song_the_afro_greeks_public_action_25_4_25/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Audience ","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Applause","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://Grace-137.github.io/AfroGreeks/remember_this_song_the_afro_greeks_public_action_25_4_25/canvas/3#t=2688,2690"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://Grace-137.github.io/AfroGreeks/remember_this_song_the_afro_greeks_public_action_25_4_25/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"At the core of this collective community project lays the passion to create live events in collaboration with members of the African communities in Greece who are co- producers and co-organizers of live actions that address crucial social issues and raise awareness.

They were literally left without any form of legal identification that could justify their presence in the country. All they possessed was a birth certificate, which did not count as a valid identification document. While the first generation of migrants was eventually required to obtain residence permits to prove their entry and employment status in Greece, there was no corresponding legal provision for their children. This “second generation” was left in a state of bureaucratic limbo. For Black boys in particular, this gap had severe consequences: they were frequently racially profiled and stopped by police as early as age 15 or 17. During such encounters, their birth certificates were dismissed as insufficient proof of identity, leading to prolonged interrogations and detentions that could last for hours while authorities attempted to determine their legal status.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Comment","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Mc Yinka","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://Grace-137.github.io/AfroGreeks/remember_this_song_the_afro_greeks_public_action_25_4_25/canvas/3#t=4301,4361"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://Grace-137.github.io/AfroGreeks/remember_this_song_the_afro_greeks_public_action_25_4_25/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Mc Yinka narrates this story in a strikingly creative way – through rhyme, rhythm and singing- but the choice of words is intentional and deeply political.

This would eventually turn into a form of dance resistance against their oppressors. \nSoon after, the miners evolved their percussive sounds and movements into a unique dance form and used it to entertain each other during their free time.
